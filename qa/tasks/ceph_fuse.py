    """
    Mount/unmount a ``ceph-fuse`` client.

    The config is optional and defaults to mounting on all clients. If
    a config is given, it is expected to be a list of clients to do
    this operation on. This lets you e.g. set up one client with
    ``ceph-fuse`` and another with ``kclient``.

    ``brxnet`` should be a Private IPv4 Address range, default range is
    [192.168.0.0/16]

    Example that mounts all clients::

        tasks:
        - ceph:
        - ceph-fuse:
        - interactive:
        - brxnet: [192.168.0.0/16]

    Example that uses both ``kclient` and ``ceph-fuse``::

        tasks:
        - ceph:
        - ceph-fuse: [client.0]
        - kclient: [client.1]
        - interactive:

    Example that enables valgrind:

        tasks:
        - ceph:
        - ceph-fuse:
            client.0:
              valgrind: [--tool=memcheck, --leak-check=full, --show-reachable=yes]
        - interactive:

    Example that stops an already-mounted client:

    ::

        tasks:
            - ceph:
            - ceph-fuse: [client.0]
            - ... do something that requires the FS mounted ...
            - ceph-fuse:
                client.0:
                    mounted: false
            - ... do something that requires the FS unmounted ...

    Example that adds more generous wait time for mount (for virtual machines):

        tasks:
        - ceph:
        - ceph-fuse:
            client.0:
              mount_wait: 60 # default is 0, do not wait before checking /sys/
              mount_timeout: 120 # default is 30, give up if /sys/ is not populated
