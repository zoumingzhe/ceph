        New scheduler that takes PlacementSpec as the bound and not as recommendation.
        I.e. the new scheduler won't suggest any new placements outside of the hosts
        specified by label etc.

        upgrading to the new scheduler.

        There is a potential race here:
        1. user updates his spec to remove daemons
