Ceph Dashboard
==============

Overview
--------

The Ceph Dashboard is a built-in web-based Ceph management and monitoring
application to administer various aspects and objects of the cluster. It is
implemented as a Ceph Manager module.

Enabling and Starting the Dashboard
-----------------------------------

If you want to start the dashboard from within a development environment, you
need to have built Ceph (see the toplevel ``README.md`` file and the `developer
documentation
<https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/dev/developer_guide/#building-from-source>`_
for details on how to accomplish this.

Finally, you need to build the dashboard frontend code. See the file
``HACKING.rst`` in this directory for instructions on setting up the necessary
development environment.

If you use the ``vstart.sh`` script to start up your development cluster, it
will configure and enable the dashboard automatically. The URL and login
credentials are displayed when the script finishes.

Please see the `Ceph Dashboard documentation
<https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/mgr/dashboard/>`_ for details on how to enable
and configure the dashboard manually and how to configure other settings, e.g.
access to the Ceph object gateway.

Working on the Dashboard Code
-----------------------------

If you're interested in helping with the development of the dashboard, please
see the file ``HACKING.rst`` for details on how to set up a development
environment and other development-related topics.
